# Aloha Project <h1>
My first website project of an Aloha clothing company. Below contains descriptions languages used in the project and what has been implemented.

## Key Learnings <h2>
HTML: Writing code via hyper text markup language in order to append content to the website. Using semantic classes and ID names in the HTML so that CSS can be styled in an organized manner. 

CSS: Classes and ID names are meaningful, so that they can be organized in groups in the index.css file. This follows the best practices of CSS styling. The classes and ID names are also named correctly (lowercase letters and using dashes for the replacement of whitespace).

Javascript: Creating variables in Javascript, allowing functions to be called. Loops are used within functions in order to create a counter for the shopping cart after each click on the add to cart button. Conditional statement is also used so that the email submit form will provide an alert messaged based off the value of the input. 

Overall: Following best practices of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to achieve maximum organization for executing design.
